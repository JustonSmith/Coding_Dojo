            <h2 class="greytext">JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p class="greytext">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.JavaScript is
                extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum
                flexibility for developers to take in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to
                provide programmic control over them. </p>
            <ul class="greytext">
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript
                    variables are containers for storing data values - inagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds
                    the coffee, and a variable holds the value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique
                    names. These unipue names are called identifiers. <span class="highlight">var x;</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_assignment.asp">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment
                    operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured into it, giving
                    our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span
                        class="highlight"> var x = 10;</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp">Data Types</a> Data types are an inportant
                    concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="highlight">true</span> or <span
                        class="highlight">false;</span> null - <span class="highlight">null</span> aka nothing: Number -
                    <span class="highlight">42</span> or<span class="highlight"> 3.14159;</span> String - <span
                        class="highlight">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span> Array - <span class="highlight">[1, 'coding' 2,
                        'dojo']</span> and Object - <span class="highlight">{first_name: Jane, last_name: Doe}</span>
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you
                    want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                    values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                    accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="highlight">if</span> a
                    specific condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="highlight">else if</span>
                    to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false: <span
                        class="highlight">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of
                    loops in ever programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an
                    action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mine, well you run around the track four
                    times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp">Functions</a> Functions are and
                    encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it
                    as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open
                    up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; nest we place
                    the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to
                    do so lets call our function over and over and over again. </li>
