// Code Challenge: Problem Solving

// I need to identify if a written paragraph is written in first, second, or third person perspective. One strategy I could use to do this would be to use the T.H.I.N.K problem solving framework.

// 1. Design a function (scanForPerspective).
// 2. Create variables to define each perspective (first(I, We, we), second(You, you), third(He, he, She, she, It, it, They, they ).). 
// 3. Scan every character for spaces.
// 4. Create variable (word) for every character in between said spaces.
// 5. Scan every variable (word) to see if it matches a variable set to a perspective.
// 6. If var(word) matches a perspective var(first, second, third), it will return that perspective.

// The most difficult part of problem solving is translating your ideas to other people. Having to start over. Making sure youre not skipping steps youll need later.
